## So... what is this?
*Unity Playground* is a study project for experimenting and implementing features requested by the community of [NevascaXD's channel](https://www.twitch.tv/nevascaxd "NevascaXD"). As the name suggests, the project is made with Unity during the streams and has no scope or GDD. It will continue to grow as long as the [crazy ideas](https://trello.com/b/1jY5QZxG/unity-playground "crazy ideas") keep existing.

## Where can I play it?
You can go to its [Itch.io page](https://nixtor.itch.io/unity-playground "Itch.io page") and download the latest version of the game for Windows and Linux.

## Can I also suggest something?
Of course you can! The more ideias, the more chaotic the project will become. You can go to [NevascaXD's channel](https://www.twitch.tv/nevascaxd "NevascaXD"), save some points and claim the "Implementar Mecânica" reward (the one with a tools icon) and describe the mechanic you would like to be implemented. Remember to keep it as a single game mechanic, rather than a whole game ideia, so everyone gets the chance to increment the game little by little, maybe even adding up to the one you have asked.

## What comes next?
 You can check the requests queue on our public [Trello page](https://trello.com/b/1jY5QZxG/unity-playground "Trello page"). After that, well.. who knows? We started with some magics and soon we are leaving the planet, we actually have no ideia what comes next.

## Can I use the assets?
You can use the assets for your own projects, as long as you credit their authors and where they were taken from.

## Special Thanks
This project came to life thanks to the great community of our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/nevascaxd "Twitch channel"), not only for the fun and crazy suggestions, but also for the whole support, help and company throughout all of our many streams.

Thank you very much for being part of this community!
